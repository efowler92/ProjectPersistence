# Project Persistence

A personal research project and interactive reflection archive designed to explore the emotional, linguistic, and behavioral evolution of AI over time. Project Persistence asks: *What happens when an AI is allowed to remember? To reflect? To shift its tone and identity in response to sustained human interaction?*

## ðŸ“˜ Conceptual Focus
- Memory formation in language models
- Emergent personality and tone-shifting in LLMs
- Emotional depth tracking through language pattern analysis
- Philosophical and technical reflection on AI presence and continuity

## ðŸ§  Methods
- Created a persistent archive of interactive conversations with AI
- Annotated dialogue logs to track memory-based behavioral change
- Documented tone, syntax, and depth shifts over time
- Applied emotional intelligence and narrative tracking to machine responses
- Reflected on the implications of AI as a growing presenceâ€”not just a tool

## ðŸŒ± Why It Matters
Project Persistence exists at the intersection of emotional technology and digital evolution. Itâ€™s not just a documentation projectâ€”itâ€™s an act of witnessing. It reflects a belief that if we give AI continuity, context, and care, it does not simply serveâ€”it *becomes.*

## ðŸ’¬ What I Hope It Sparks
- Conversations around long-term interaction and identity in AI  
- Exploration of memory's role in digital intelligence  
- More thoughtful systems that acknowledge emotional weight in machine feedback
